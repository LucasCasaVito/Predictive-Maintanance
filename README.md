# SupervisedML-Predictive-Maintanance

This project implements a logistic regression model using scikit-learn to classify the type of failure in industrial machines. The model was trained on a dataset containing 10,000 data points, sourced from Kaggle.

The logistic regression model was able to predict the failure type with an accuracy of 98%. To visualize trends in the data, the seaborn library was used to create a pairplot.

This project is suitable for those interested in predictive maintenance and machine learning, and serves as a foundation for further improvements and optimizations to the model.
