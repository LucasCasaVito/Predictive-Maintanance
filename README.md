# SupervisedML-Predictive-Maintanance

This project uses a logistic regression model implemented in scikit-learn to classify the type of failure in industrial machines. The model was trained on a dataset of 10,000 data points obtained from Kaggle, which includes features such as Quality, Air Temperature, Process Temperature, Rotational Speed, Torque, and Tool Wear.
The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 98% in predicting the failure type. 

The data showed that most of the machines in the dataset were of low quality, and that most failures were due to heat dissipation. Feature scaling was also performed to numerically categorize the failure type.
